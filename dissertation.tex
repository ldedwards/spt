\section{Introduction}
Stochastic Portfolio Theory (\textbf{SPT}) was first introduced by Fernholz and 
Shay (1982) \cite{fernholz1982}, formalised in Fernholz (1999) 
\cite{fernholz1999} and was further developed by Fernholz (2002) 
\cite{fernholz2002}. It has evolved into a flexible framework for analyzing 
portfolio behavior and equity market structure that has both theoretical and 
practical applications.

From a theoretical standpoint, the framework provides insight into questions 
regarding the behaviour of the market as well as arbitrage, and can be used to 
construct portfolios with controlled behavior under quite general assumptions. 

The framework does not assume the existence of equivalent local martingale
measures (equivalent to the assumption of \textbf{No Free Lunch with Vanishing 
Risk} (NFLVR)), detailed by Delbaen and Schachermayer \cite{delbaen1994}. In 
fact, most models developed in the framework satisfy only the weaker \textbf{No 
Unbounded Profit with Bounded Risk assumption} (NUPBR), which holds if and only 
if a local martingale deflator exists, which was shown by Kardaras 
\cite{kardaras2012}. 

NUPBR plays the role of Radon-Nikodym derivative in the case that an equivalent
local martingale measure does exist.  Karatzas and Kardaras (2007) proved that 
NUPBR is a necessary and sufficient condition for the log-utility maximization 
problem to have a solution. For an overview of these different notions of 
arbitrage, and their relation to the existence of deflators and equivalent 
measures, we refer the reader to Fontana (2015).

As a practical tool, SPT has been applied to the analysis and optimization of 
portfolio performance and has been the basis of successful equity investment 
strategies for over a decade.

* importance of portfolio construction in finance
* proportion of the market that is passively investing wealth in financial 
market has been growing
* a relatively recent approach to creating portfolios

A thorough survey in Fernholz and Karatzas \cite{karatzas2009} and recently
by Vervuurt \cite{vervuurt2015}.

* relatively general market model is assumed
* continuous-time model with weak no-arbitrage assumptions
* portfolio selection criteria is to outperform a benchmark with probability 1
* relies on a method of \textit{functional generation} to constructs portfolios
that rely deterministically only on the market capitalisation (or equivalently 
prices)

An example is the Diversity weighted portfolios (DWP)
* builds on the concept of diversification leading to superior returns
* we present the in-depth theoretical basis showing that the DWP outperforms the 
market index, including recent enhancements by \cite{vervuurt2016} that
extend the basic formulation to include negative-weighted parameters.
* We also provide an empirical study of the European market that confirms this.

\section{Preliminaries}
\subsection{Diffusion Processes}

We introduce the stochastic process known as a Brownian motion (also sometimes 
referred to as a Weiner process).

\begin{defn}[Standard Brownian Motion]
A Standard Brownian motion $W$ is a stochastic process which is a mapping 
$W:[0,\infty)\times\Omega\to\mathbb{R}$ for a probability
space $(\Omega,\mathcal{F},P)$ which has the properties:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item $W(0)=0$, a.s.,
	\item $W(t)$ has \textbf{independent increments,}
	\item $W(t)$ has \textbf{stationary increments} 
		$W(t)-W(s)\thicksim\mathcal{N}(0,t-s)$for $0\le s<t<\infty,$
	\item the sample trajectories for almost all $\omega\in\Omega$ the paths 
		$t\to W(t,\omega)$ are \textbf{almost surely continuous.}
\end{enumerate}
\end{defn}

\subsection{It\^{o} Calculus}

\section{Stochastic Portfolio Theory}

\subsection{It\^{o} Market Model}

We proceed as in \cite{karatzas2009} and place ourselves in a continuous-time, 
classical market model of Stochastic Portfolio Theory, where stock 
capitalisations are modelled as It\^{o} processes.

\renewcommand{\d}[1]{\mathrm{d}{#1}}
\newcommand{\realnumbers}{\mathbb{R}}

\begin{equation}
\d{X_{i}(t)} = X_{i}(t) \left( b_{i}(t)\d{t} + \sum_{\nu=1}^{d} 
\sigma_{i\nu}(t){\d{W_{\nu}(t)}} \right), 
\;i=1,\cdots,n,\;X_{i}(0)=x_{i}\in\realnumbers^{+}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
	\mathrm{d}{\log X_{i}(t)}=\gamma_{i}(t)\mathrm{d}t
\end{equation}

\subsection{Portfolios and Wealth}

\subsubsection{The Market Portfolio}
One of the most researched applications of Stochastic Portfolio Theory is that 
of portfolio construction. Here the objective of portfolio construction is to 
selection a portfolios is to exploit arbitrages that may be present in the 
market. Typically this performance is measured with respect to a benchmark, as 
in the Benchmark Approach of Platen and Heath \cite{platen2006}.

\begin{defn}[Market Portfolio]
We introduce the Market Portfolio, as the process of market weights 
$\mu(\centerdot)$ defined by \begin{equation}
	\mu_{i}(t)\triangleq\frac{X_{i}(t)}{X(t)},\;\;\;\;X(t)\triangleq\sum_{i=1}^{n}X_{i}(t).
\end{equation}
\end{defn}

\subsection{Relative Arbitrage}
\subsection{Functionally Generated Portfolios}
\subsection{Rank-based Portfolios}
\subsection{Trading Strategies}

\section{Diversity Weighted Portfolios}

Diversity is clearly observed in real markets, and its validity is guaranteed by 
the fact that anti-trust regulations are typically in place. This assumption was 
first studied in detail in the context of SPT by Fernholz, Karatzas and Kardaras 
\cite{fernholz2005}, who defined and studied different forms of diversity, and 
proved that under an additional nondegeneracy condition on the stock 
volatilities, relative arbitrages exist in such markets - both over sufficiently 
long time horizons, as well as over arbitrarily short time horizons.
